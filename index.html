      <p class="message">My dearest April,<br><br>
        I have no words to say I am so lucky to have you in my life. <br>
        I wish I could be right there now hugging you and say happy birthday, and I promise that one day it will come.
        Doesn't even begin to describe how I feel about you. You are the best person that i ever met,
        one of those people that you know you will remember for the rest of your life, my best friend.
        Here are just a few of the reasons why I love you, and why you deserve a great day. <br>
        The best of all and that is what I am going to start with is your way of being, an old-fashioned lover girl, one
        of the wonders that thank God I had the opportunity to meet,<br> another one that I like the most is the way it
        is the way in which you like to appreciate things, live each moment and make it look as if it were unique, also
        the ones that I like so much are the good recommendations of movies certified by Dr. Miss.April Machta Movie
        Recommendator professional. Unfortunately I can't keep writing as I'm running out of space, Happy birthday
        dearling <br> <br> With love, your biggest fan, Giova â™¥</p>
